# Course 3 End-of-course project: Exploratory data analysis

In this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. You will also design a professional data visualization (via Tableau) that tells a story, and will help data-driven decisions for business needs. 

Please note that the Tableau visualization activity is optional, and will not affect your completion of the course. Completing the Tableau activity will help you practice planning out and plotting a data visualization based on a specific business need. The structure of this activity is designed to emulate the proposals you will likely be assigned in your career as a data professional. Completing this activity will help prepare you for those career moments.

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in Course 2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables. 
  
**The goal** is to clean data set and create a visualization.
